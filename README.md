<h2>Short Analysis of the Performance of the Kernel</h2>

<p align=center>
Across various inputs sizes and configuration, the result from assembly implementation consistently is faster than c implementation in terms of the average execution time.
</p>
<p align=center>
The performance from using assembly is more noticeable as the input size increases. This shows that the assembly implementation is more efficient compared to c implementation, especially when dealing with larger datasets.
</p>
<p align=center>
In conclusion, the performance of the assembly implementation of the kernel is better to that of the C implementation. 
It also demonstrates its efficiency and the value of optimizing code in critical situations with programming languages like assembly.
